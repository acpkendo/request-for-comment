## Proposal overview

Create a free Google account for our project that will be shared among PSC members and working group leaders.
This account will give us:

- A shared community calendar that we can make public
- A common drive for storing and sharing project files
- A mail account
- A shared Google Meet account
- A shared Contacts list
- Access to other free Google services


## Motivation

This year our project has experimented with a federated model of governance, in which our key project initiatives are worked on by permanent and ad-hoc working groups.
While this new model has helped make our community more productive and distributed leadership opportunities throughout the community, it's also come with a few logistical headaches:

- It's difficult for community members to see all the different working groups meetings in one calendar.
- Community members can't simply add themselves to a working group meeting (they must be added manually).
- There's no central location for people to store and access non-binary files being produced in various working groups (such as Google Doc files, slide decks, and other project assets).
- Cameron notes that we can also provide access at the directory level without providing full access to the account.
- Aaron notes that there seems to be the ability to delegate access to the account, which allows us to easily add/remove members while also relieving users of the need to remember Yet Another Password.

Creating a shared, free Google account will solve many of these problems and give us access to tools that will improve our project's productivity.


## Proposal

I propose we create a free Google account for our project: `thegooddocsproject@gmail.com`.

NOTE: I'm basing this name off of our website domain name.


### Why is this a good idea?

As I mentioned in the motivation section, this will solve a lot of problems we're having and introduce some helpful features that we could take advantage of:

- Community members would be able to access a public calendar and see all Good Docs meetings in a single pane of glass.
- Rather than contacting a meeting organizer directly and asking to be added, community members could copy the calendar item to their own calendar and add themselves.
- We can keep a better historical record of non-GitHub assets like drafts or files in Google Docs, slide decks, etc. The project itself doesn't necessarily need to own these assets as long as they are shared with the project's Google account so that they show up in the shared drive.
- We could possibly use the mail account for official communications.
- We could use this official account to create accounts for other free services (such as social media).
- There's probably even more benefits that I haven't thought to list here!

Cameron notes: From a quick experiment, it appears that I can set up meeting permissions to allow others to add/remove meeting members, or change the meeting time.
This should make it easier to for us to remain relatively restrictive in providing account access, while still giving everyone the ability to use the calendar and files.


### Regulating account access

Access will be shared with community members on an as-needed basis.
The goal is to avoid being too restrictive or too liberal with access to this account.
We want to avoid a situation in which only one person has access to this account because that puts too much control in the hands of one community member.
If that community member becomes unresponsive for various reasons, it could be difficult to access the account.
However, we also want to avoid a situation in which most community members have access to the account because that could compromise our project's overall security.
It might also be advisable to ensure that account access is distributed across a few individuals in a few different time zone regions (such as the US, APEC, and EMEA).

For that reason, when the account is first created, the account credentials will be shared with:

- The current project chair
- The vice-chair or another trusted member of the project steering committee

Other individuals may possibly request access to the Google account for these reasons:

- You are leading multiple working groups and need to update meeting details regularly
- Your working group is creating a lot of files and assets that should be stored in the shared project Google Drive
- You have been authorized by the project steering committee to create an account with another service using our Google account
- You need to use the project mail account regularly to communicate with others in an official capacity
- Additional important reasons that we haven't yet thought of
- You are a community builder, and are regularly setting up access for new members into our community.

Members who are granted Google account access should be trusted by the community.
They should have demonstrated trustworthiness, typically by contributing impactfully to the community for at least a quarter (3 months).

Being a member of the project steering committee helps but should not necessarily be required.

Access can be granted by reaching out to the project chair or vice-chair, who will raise a motion and encourage voting from the project steering committee members.

Cameron adds: We can provide access on a per-directory basis. For example, `Reg Rev-head` could be given permission to create and delete files in the `car-racing-templates` directory without needing the main password.


### Rotating passwords

I propose we set up a cadence for changing our account passwords.
Unless someone thinks it should be more frequent, I'm open to changing the password once a year, or immediately after a possible password compromise.

We could also consider changing it when certain project events occur, such as when a PSC member who had access steps down.

Aaron adds: It also gives us the ability to delegate access to the account, which might alleviate some of the fears regarding bad actors.
That ability will allow us to easily add/remove members while also relieving users of the need to remember Yet Another Password.


### Why a free Google account as opposed to something else?

You might wonder why I'm propsing that we set up a free, basic Google/Gmail account as opposed to some other service.

I researched the prospect of creating a Google Workspaces (formerly known as GSuite) account for our project, but since we are not a 501(c)(3), we would not qualify for a free account.
We could pay for an account (it's roughly $12-18 /user/month), but then we'd introduce the complications of taking in funds and paying for accounts.
Our project probably isn't ready for financial complexity yet, especially since we don't have a formal legal status or an acting treasurer.

I'm not aware of any other viable options that give us the functionality that we need, but I'm open to suggestions.
Carrie Crowe also researched other options and reached the same conclusion that I reached.


### Risks or reasons not to adopt this RFC

A few potential risks:

- If we make our community calendar public, we could increase the chance of bad actors crashing our meetings, but I think this is a risk worth taking.
- A community member with access to the shared Google Drive might accidentally or intentionally delete files that should not be deleted. For that reason, access to the Google Drive should be segmented by folders.
- We should avoid exhanging sensitive information on this account (such as contact information and potentially financial information). If sensitive information is contained on this account, it should be segmented to a specific drive with access that is only granted on an as-needed basis.

Additional comments:

Erin states: two cents on the 'crashing meetings' ... we had this happen to a Season of Docs Meet and it was extremely unpleasant.
There are coordinated groups who look for open links and bomb them with attack sounds, NSFW content, and more.
Once the trolls joined, we were unable to keep them from sharing their screens and we could not keep them muted.
There are some new features in Meet that may mitigate this, but wanted to share this fwiw.

She continues: I think that we could have the calendar public, but not allow autojoining (eg not allow "anyone with the link" to join), and both require that anyone who wants to join ping 24 hours in advance of the meeting and have a policy of not allowing unknown users (eg not already active members or people who pinged to join in advance) into the meeting during the meeting.

## Implemention checklist

If this proposal is accepted, the following tasks must be completed:

- [ ] Set up the Google account
- [ ] Provide access to the community members that need access to start
- [ ] Create a public calendar and convert all our project meetings to this calendar
- [ ] Test the calendar's functionality to determine whether community members can access it and add themselves to meetings as needed
- [ ] Document the process for adding yourself to a meeting and make sure this document is easy to find
- [ ] Add the public calendar to the website and working group details pages
- [ ] Notify community members about the new community calendar and provide links
- [ ] Ensure that our shared Google Drive has the files it needs (such as Google Docs drafts or other files created by working groups)
