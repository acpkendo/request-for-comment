## Proposal overview

Create a free Google account for our project that will be shared among PSC members and working group leaders.
This account will give us:

- A shared community calendar that we can make public
- A common drive for storing and sharing project files
- A mail account
- A shared Google Meet account
- A shared Contacts list
- Access to other free Google services


## Motivation

This year our project has experimented with a federated model of governance, in which our key project initiatives are worked on by permanent and ad-hoc working groups.
While this new model has helped make our community more productive and distributed leadership opportunities throughout the community, it's also come with a few logistical headaches:

- It's difficult for community members to see all the different working groups meetings in one calendar.
- Community members can't simply add themselves to a working group meeting (they must be added manually).
- There's no central location for people to store and access non-binary files being produced in various working groups (such as Google Doc files, slide decks, and other project assets).

Creating a shared, free Google account will solve many of these problems and give us access to tools that will improve our project's productivity.


## Proposal

I propose we create a free Google account for our project: `thegooddocsproject@gmail.com`.

NOTE: I'm basing this name off of our website domain name.


### Why is this a good idea?

As I mentioned in the motivation section, this will solve a lot of problems we're having and introduce some helpful features that we could take advantage of:

- Community members would be able to access a public calendar and see all Good Docs meetings in a single pane of glass.
- Rather than contacting a meeting organizer directly and asking to be added, community members could copy the calendar item to their own calendar and add themselves.
- We can keep a better historical record of non-GitHub assets like drafts or files in Google Docs, slide decks, etc. The project itself doesn't necessarily need to own these assets as long as they are shared with the project's Google account so that they show up in the shared drive.
- We could possibly use the mail account for official communications.
- We could use this official account to create accounts for other free services (such as social media).
- There's probably even more benefits that I haven't thought to list here!


### Regulating account access

Access will be shared with community members on an as-needed basis.
The goal is to avoid being too restrictive or too liberal with access to this account.
We want to avoid a situation in which only one person has access to this account because that puts too much control in the hands of one community member.
If that community member becomes unresponsive for various reasons, it could be difficult to access the account.
However, we also want to avoid a situation in which most community members have access to the account because that could compromise our project's overall security.
It might also be advisable to ensure that account access is distributed across a few individuals in a few different time zone regions (such as the US, APEC, and EMEA).

For that reason, when the account is first created, the account credentials will be shared with:

- The current project chair (Alyssa)
- The vice-chair (we need to create this position and nominate someone to it)
- The templates coordinator (we need to create this position and nominate someone to it; a future RFC that I'm submitting will make a recommendation for this role and it will likely be Aidan Doherty)

Other individuals may possibly request access to the Google account for these reasons:

- You are leading multiple working groups and need to update meeting details regularly
- Your working group is creating a lot of files and assets that should be stored in the shared project Google Drive
- You have been authorized by the project steering committee to create an account with another service using our Google account
- You need to use the project mail account regularly to communicate with others in an official capacity
- Additional important reasons that we haven't yet thought of

Members who are granted Google account access should be trusted by the community.
They should have demonstrated trustworthiness, typically by contributing impactfully to the community for at least a quarter (3 months).

Being a member of the project steering committee helps but should not necessarily be required.

Access can be granted by reaching out to the project chair or vice-chair, who will raise a motion and encourage voting from the project steering committee members.


### Rotating passwords

I propose we set up a cadence for changing our account passwords.
Unless someone thinks it should be more frequent, I'm open to changing the password once a year.
We could also consider changing it when certain project events occur, such as when a PSC member who had access steps down.


### Why a free Google account as opposed to something else?

You might wonder why I'm propsing that we set up a free, basic Google/Gmail account as opposed to some other service.

I researched the prospect of creating a Google Workspaces (formerly known as GSuite) account for our project, but since we are not a 501(c)(3), we would not qualify for a free account.
We could pay for an account (it's roughly $12-18 /user/month), but then we'd introduce the complications of taking in funds and paying for accounts.
Our project probably isn't ready for financial complexity yet, especially since we don't have a formal legal status or an acting treasurer.

I'm not aware of any other viable options that give us the functionality that we need, but I'm open to suggestions.
Carrie Crowe also researched other options and reached the same conclusion that I reached.


### Risks or reasons not to adopt this RFC

The only risks I can think of are that if we make our community calendar public, we could increase the chance of bad actors crashing our meetings, but I think this is a risk worth taking.

I think another risk is that this account will possibly have access to sensitive information (such as contact information and potentially financial information).
That's a heavy responsibility that we should never take lightly.
For that reason, we need to make sure that this kind of information is restricted in the Google Drive or we need to review account access to ensure that only individuals who truly need access have it as I've outlined in a previous section.

## Implemention checklist

If this proposal is accepted, the following tasks must be completed:

- [ ] Set up the Google account
- [ ] Provide access to the community members that need access to start
- [ ] Create a public calendar and convert all our project meetings to this calendar
- [ ] Test the calendar's functionality to determine whether community members can access it and add themselves to meetings as needed
- [ ] Document the process for adding yourself to a meeting and make sure this document is easy to find
- [ ] Add the public calendar to the website and working group details pages
- [ ] Notify community members about the new community calendar and provide links
- [ ] Ensure that our shared Google Drive has the files it needs (such as Google Docs drafts or other files created by working groups)
