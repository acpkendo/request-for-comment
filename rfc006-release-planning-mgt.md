## Proposal overview

This proposal outlines a process to plan for and manage releases for The Good Docs Project. Specifically, it will detail:

- The process through which the project defines and agrees on a Release;
- The versioning scheme the project will use to track and communicate progress across Releases, and;
- The tooling the project will use to manage progress towards Releases.


## Motivation

The Good Docs Project has grown to contain multiple sub-initiatives ranging from the templates (arguably the core of the project's activities at time of writing), to tooling aimed at technical writers, to useful content in the form of example documentation and blog posts.

Given the project's increasing membership across multiple time zones, implementing a standard process through which the Project Steering Committee can define and manage releases will align expectations and better enable monitoring of progress.
