## Proposal overview

The Good Docs Project's [glossary working group](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/working-group/) wish to establish a glossary specific landing page and associated repository.


## Motivation

Within the glossary working group:
* We want to present ourselves as a stand-alone project, under the umbella of The Good Docs Project.
* We want a website describing all details associated with glossaries, such as a landing page, howtos, current project status, how to contact us, etc.

## Proposal

We propose to:
* Establish a subdomain: https://glossaries.thegooddocsproject.dev and populate this with content.
* Populate the existing github repository: https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/glossaries where we will develop the content for the website.
* Establish a new github repository: https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/glossary-schema to manage the development of the schema.
* Apply a license of CC-By 4.0 to both repositories and website.

## Consequences

* This will be the first instance of a subdomain of thegooddocsproject.dev, and is setting a precedent which other sub-projects will likely follow.

## Decisions deferred

* What tech stack will we use for publishing the website?  Possibly the same hugo website set up as used by https://thegooddocsproject.dev.
* What page structure and content will be on the website?
* Where will we store the public schema for the defacto standard glossary we are developing? This URL will be referenced by other schemas. We will probably use [https://w3id.org](https://w3id.org) which is used by other schemas for this purpose.
