## Proposal overview

This RFC is open to suggestions from the community for minor and major suggestions to improve the RFC process.
To make your suggestion to the process, add a comment to the "Feedback" section of this file or to this PR.


## Motivation

We've completed the RFC process with at least one RFC now and we've learned a few lessons along the way.
Some members of the community expressed a desire to make a few minor tweaks and improvements and this RFC is designed to facilitate that discussion.


## Proposal

Make your suggestions here.
Near the end of the community discussion period, I'll take the suggestions and add them to this section.
After that, we'll open the final comment period and discuss the final changes.
